##### What new skills have you learned?
I have learned how to use HTML syntax by converting a mockup of a blog article into a real website.

##### What has been easy?
This is easy for me because I have three years professional experience of markup language and style sheet language, such as HTML5 and CSS3.

##### What has been difficult?
Nothing has been difficult. The project is quite simple and straightforward.

##### How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
I often get stuck on a coding problem from the first project, and the best way is to use research on the internet, textbooks, and video notes. These are all resources I use in order to solve the problem.
